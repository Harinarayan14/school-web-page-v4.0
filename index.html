        Anand Niketan School Mehsana focuses on the all-round development of a child. Some students are intellectually 
        bright and learn quickly from the academics provided and from the activities undergone. Our teachers mentor them towards 
        their bright career by helping them lay the extra stone in their solid foundation. Other students take their own sweet time 
        to achieve success.
    </p>

        Success stories are the result of the integrated efforts of the school, the teachers, the students and the parents.
         Our students succeed in innovation, academics, sports, theatre, dance, declamation, debate and many more.
         The quantum of success is remarkable as per the age of every child in the school.
